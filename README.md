# Simulation of Flying Objects
This project is a simulation of flying objects in a 2D world. 
The objects have specific properties, and a REST API is implemented to query and retrieve data from the simulation.

## Getting started
Setup your environment with the `make setup` command.

To start the simulation use the `make run` command.

To start the endpoint use the `make app` command.

You can adjust configurations in the `src/config.py` file.

## Main Objects
`The World:`

> The world is a finite 2D-plane with a linear coordinate system.
> The x-axis and y-axis range from 0 to 1000 km.
> The world is divided into four sectors:
> Sector A: x >= 0 and x < 500 km, y >= 0 and y < 500 km
> Sector B: x >= 500 and x <= 1000 km, y >= 0 and y < 500 km
> Sector C: x >= 0 and x < 500 km, y >= 500 and y <= 1000 km
> Sector D: x >= 500 and x <= 1000 km, y >= 500 and y <= 1000 km

---

`The Object:`

> The object has the following properties:
> * Object ID: A string matching the regular expression /[0-9a-z]{32}/gmU.
> * x-coordinate: x value existing in the world.
> * y-coordinate: y value existing in the world.
> * Angle (rad) between direction vector and the x-axis (up 0, right pi/2, down pi, left 3pi/2). Negative values are converted to positives, e.g., -pi/2 becomes 3pi/2.
> * Speed: m/s.
> * Expire time: Time to reach the destination.
> * Created time: Time of object creation.
> * Payload: Random hexadecimal data with a size of 100 bytes (immutable).
> * Simulation Application
> * Simulated Timeframe
> * The simulation runs for 10 hours starting from an arbitrary date and time (e.g., 1st of December 2006 at 13:00).

`Simulated Object:`

> An object is created in any initial position inside the World.
> A destination is created for the object, located at any point in the World, with the distance between the object's initial and destination points ranging from 150 to 400 km.
> A waypoint is created for the object, located at any point in the World, with the distance between the object's initial and waypoint ranging from 100 to 150 km.
> The object moves on a trajectory created as a quadratic BÃ©zier curve from the origin point, waypoint, and the destination point.
> The object's speed is immutable and ranges from 10 to 80 m/s.

---

`Generator:`

> The simulation generates 500 simulated objects inside the specified timeframe.
> Each object has a random starting time within the timeframe.
> If the calculated expiration time exceeds the timeframe, it is acceptable, and the object expires within the simulation.
> The object's position, angle, expire time, and the sector in which the object is positioned are updated every 150 ms.
> The object's position is calculated according to its trajectory, initial speed, starting time, and current time.
> Every change of every object is logged with the object's data.

---

`API:`

> A simple REST API is provided for pulling data from the simulation logs.
> 
> ### Query #1: 
> Pull a specific object's trajectory in a given timeframe.
> 
> Input: object ID, start time, end time.
> Output: Object data, including the payload and the object's approximated trajectory inside the queried start and end times.
> ### Query #2: 
>Pull a snapshot from any sector in a given timeframe.
> 
> Input: sector ID, start time, end time.
> Output: All objects, sorted by their first appearance inside the queried sector, with object data (without payload) and approximated object trajectory inside the queried sector.
> Note: Any parts of trajectories outside the queried sector are truncated to the last visible appearance inside the queried sector.
